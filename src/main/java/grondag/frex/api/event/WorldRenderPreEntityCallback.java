	 * Called after the Solid, Cutout and Cutout Mipped terrain layers have been output to the framebuffer.
	 *
	 * <p>Typical usage is to render non-translucent terrain to the framebuffer.
	 *
	 * <p>Note that 3rd-party renderers may combine these passes or otherwise alter the
	 * rendering pipeline for sake of performance or features. This can break direct writes to the
	 * framebuffer.  Use this event for cases that cannot be satisfied by FabricBakedModel,
	 * BlockEntityRenderer or other existing abstraction. If at all possible, use an existing terrain
	 * RenderLayer instead of outputting to the framebuffer directly with GL calls.
	 *
	 * <p>The consumer is responsible for setup and tear down of GL state appropriate for the intended output.
	 *
	 * <p>Because solid and cutout quads are depth-tested, order of output does not matter except to improve
	 * culling performance, which should not be significant after primary terrain rendering. This means
	 * mods that currently hook calls to individual render layers can simply execute them all at once when
	 * the event is called.
	 *
	 * <p>This event fires before entities and block entities are rendered and may be useful to prepare them.
