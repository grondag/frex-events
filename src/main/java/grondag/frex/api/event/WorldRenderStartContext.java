	 * The {@code VertexConsumerProvider} instance being used by the world renderer for most non-terrain renders.
	 * Generally this will be better for any direct renders because quads for the same layer can be cached
	 * and then drawn all at once by the world renderer.
	 *
	 * <p>IMPORTANT - all vertex coordinates sent to consumers should be relative to the camera to
	 * be consistent with other quads emitted by the world renderer and other mods.  If this isn't
	 * possible, caller should use a separate "immediate" instance.
	 *
	 * <p>If the renderer implementation supports {@code FrexVertexConsumerProvider} this instance can be
	 * cast to that type, and caller can use the extended features available in FREX materials.
